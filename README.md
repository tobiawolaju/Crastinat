# Crastinat

**Stop delaying. Start living.**

> *If it’s not on the timeline, it doesn’t exist.*

Crastinat is a **personal time editor** built to turn intention into reality. It helps you beat procrastination, manage opportunities, and organize your life by **visualizing time as a timeline** you can edit, reorder, and commit to.

---

## Why Crastinat exists

Procrastination isn’t laziness — it’s the **gap between plans and reality**.
Most tools let you plan. Crastinat makes plans **happen**.

* Turn scattered ideas into a 24-hour timeline
* See your day, week, or month at a glance
* Remove friction from decisions
* Turn goals into actual, lived time

---

## How it works

### 1. Timeline-first interface

* 24-hour horizontal timeline
* Drag, resize, split, and reorder time blocks
* Visual overview of your entire day

### 2. Chat-based planning

Type naturally:

```
I’m swimming on weekends at 5pm for 3 hours
```

Crastinat:

* Understands intent
* Places it correctly on the timeline
* Sets reminders
* Syncs with Google Calendar

### 3. Edit your life

* Drag & drop events
* Adjust durations visually
* Reorder priorities instantly

### 4. Optional tagging & sharing

* Tag blocks (#work, #study, #health)
* Collaboration is optional — Crastinat is **personal first**

## What Crastinat is **not**

* ❌ A to-do list
* ❌ A habit tracker
* ❌ A motivational app
* ❌ A note-taking tool

Crastinat doesn’t ask *what you want to do*. It asks *when it will actually happen*.

## Philosophy

> **If it’s not on the timeline, it doesn’t exist.**

* Anything not in Crastinat is optional.
* Anything in Crastinat is real.
* Time is your most valuable asset — treat it like footage to edit.
